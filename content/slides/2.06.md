* strong correlation between the frequency with which respondents visit museums and the frequency with which respondents visit museum websites
*  the frequency with which online visitors visit museum websites was fairly strongly correlated with the importance survey respondents place on museums having museum websites

# Limitations

...the use of an exploratory survey research method restricted respondents to people who were:

* (a) already visiting museum websites, and
* (b) chose to answer a survey about museums and museum websites.
* In addition, the placement of the survey link on each museum's home page may have introduced an unintentional bias, as it is possible that visitors to a museum's home page are more likely to be planning a museum visit than visitors to other pages on a museum's website.
* Also, the survey's focus on museum visitation may have biased the results for those online visitors who have no intention of visiting physical museums.
