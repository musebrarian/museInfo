# Information
## The information a museum holds can be as important as the collections themselves.

* Without information the context and history of the objects is lost.
* The stories of the objects are lost.
* The investment in staff resources to research and investiage objects is lost.
* Undiscoverable and unusable information is lost.

* _Wisdom:_ Wisdom adds value, which requires the mental function that we call judgment. The ethical and aesthetic values that this implies are inherent to the actor and are unique and personal.
* _Knowledge:_ What is known by a person or persons. Involves interpreting information received, adding relevance and context to clarify the insights the information contains.
* _Information:_ Produced through processing, manipulating and organizing data to answer questions, adding to the knowledge of the receiver.
* _Data:_ Data are numbers, words or images that have yet to be organized or analyzed to answer a specific question.

# What is Information Policy?

An information policy will provide you with a context for making decisions about the way in which your museum creates, uses, provide access to, manages and preserves its information resources. An information policy should take account of legal, political, economic, professional, ethical and user expectations in order to set out a museum-wide view of:

* What ‘information’ means to the museum
* The objectives of information use in the museum
* The objectives of information services provided by the museum
* The principles of managing information which need to be applied across the museum
* The principles for the use and development of human and technological resources and for ensuring cost-effectiveness
* How information relates to the museum’s overall objectives.

---
# Collections Information
* Descriptive information
* Provenance data (where did this come from? How did the museum acquire it?)
  * [Getty Provenance Index](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/search.html)
* Legal Obligations
  * [Nazi-era provenance](http://www.nepip.org/)
  * Native American Graves Protection & Repatriation Act (NAGPRA)

---
# Intellectual Property

* Copyright
  * Berne Convention
  * Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA)
* But copyright is very complex, especially when it comes to contemporary and living artists.

---
# Open Access Policies

* [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/)
* [Rights Statements](https://rightsstatements.org/en/)
* [Open Data Commons](https://opendatacommons.org/)

---
# Open Access
* Open-access is a mission driven activity.
* There is a wide variety of approaches to open access currently in use.
* Internal process is important.
* Loss of control fades as a concern.
* Technology matters.
* Revenue matters less than many institutions think it does.
* Change is Good.

# Information Ethics
* Appropriate uses?
  * [Traditional Knowledge Labels](http://localcontexts.org/tk-labels/)

## Defend these propositions:

* _Team 1:_  Museums need to fully protect the items in their care by exercising strong rights over images of their objects.  Museums best fulfill their missions when they seek compensation for use and ensure that images are used in an appropriate manner.

* _Team 2:_  Museums can best achieve their missions by openly sharing their collections and knowledge with the public.  While this may not directly generate income, it engenders public good will that has other benefits.  By sharing its collections, museums can participate in wider public discourse related to their mission.
