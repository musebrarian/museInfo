* Convergence in Practice
  * More projects (partly through  support of funders) integrate digital collections.
* Convergence in Education
  * How did you hear about this course?  
  * How is/should it be integrated with the Museum Studies curriculum?
* Convergence: Theory vs. Practice
  * Should LAMs converge?
* I’d add a fourth area of concern:  
  * how are LAMs building  access to digital humanities scholars?

# Professional Networking

* Look for conference scholarship opportunities
* Many organizations have LinkedIn Groups
* Use social networks to market yourself. Twitter can bring you to the attention of key museum informatics professionals (follow me @musebrarian)

* Competition for positions in museums is fairly intense.
* Experience counts.
  * Unlike ALA, there are few requirements for the MLIS. So you're competing with anyone with the right skills/experience, especially in "technical" positions.
* Do a practicum/internship as part of your degree.
* Volunteer at a local museum – tech volunteers are also in short supply.
* Volunteer at MCN/MW/AAM/VRA, etc.
* These may be harder to find out on the web.  Contact museum HR departments.

# 2018 Art Museum Demographic Survey

> **While the overall gender composition remained static, a higher percentage of women now hold executive level positions than in 2015. Directorships remain majority male, and curatorial roles with management responsibilities are more likely to be staffed by men than those without management responsibilities.**

# 2018 Art Museum Demographic Survey

> **There has been a substantial increase in hiring people of color in the last four years, particularly in curatorial and education departments. Conservation and museum leadership roles have not made this shift in hiring. We hope this report can inform strategy as leaders in the field work towards a more equitable and representative workforce.**
