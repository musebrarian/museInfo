# Context and Looking Ahead

In week 1.04, we'll be taking a look at museum evaluation methods that touch on some of your discussion questions.  

* Visitor Studies: How do we know what we know about museum visitors? (and non-visitors)
  * https://www.visitorstudies.org/
* Qualitative vs. Quantitative data

# User Journey Exercise
## Groups A & B:  Museum Professionals
Congratulations!  Your Consulting Group has been hired by Museum A and Museum B to develop a user journey map for the museum.

* You get to decide what Museum X is. (Make one up or use one you are familiar with)
* Decide what kind of journey you want to map.
* What problems are you trying to solve?
* What are the steps you want a visitor to walk through?

# User Journey Exercise
## Groups C & D:  Museum Visitors
Congratulations!  You have been invited by Museum A and Museum B to participate in a journey mapping exercise.

* Work amongst yourselves to complete a Persona template.
* As a group, you will bring this persona to life in the context of the user journey.
* Put yourself in this persona's shoes an think about:
  * What are you doing?
  * What are you thinking?
  * What are you feeling?
* Where can you ground your persona in data? (look for museum visitation data (i.e. Know Your Own Bone,  Pew Internet & American Life Survey, ))
