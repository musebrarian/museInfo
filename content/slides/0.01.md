# Expectations
## This is a graduate-level course.
* Use scholarship, research, and peer-reviewed publications to support your work.
* Read. Think. Learn Independently.
* There's lots of readings available to you, but this isn't because I'm going to quiz you on every detail. I'm equipping you for a quest into the world of museum informatics.  These are tools to help you expand and grow.

---
# Expectations
* I don't assume you are "techy."
* I don't assume you are expert in museology.
* I don't expect you are an art historian, educator, anthropologist, etc.

*But if you are, please do bring your expertise to the class.*

# Activities

* *Activities* are small tasks that get you oriented to trying and testing museum technologies and/or methods of working.
  * Your Museum Journey
  * Museum Website Screencast
  * Social Media Classification
  * Museum Metadata

---
# Discussions and Explorations

* Class will be divided into two groups that alternate responsibilities.
* *Discussion:*  Post provocative questions and synthesis of the readings.
  * You are _*discouraged*_ from simply regurgitating what articles are about. Let's have a conversation about what this all means. (see the rubric in Grading and Evaluation)
* *Explorations:* Use the topic/readings as a launch point, find relevant examples, additional readings, or challenges to what we are discussing.
* *Everybody!*  Participate by commenting/responding/engaging with others.
* *In-class Participation:* Engage in synchronous discussions and activities. Make a contribution to our time together.

---
# Project Assignments

* Using design thinking approaches, identify a problem/opportunity/audience need that can be addressed through technology.
* Iterative assignments will build confidence and allow you to develop ideas.
* You must build some kind of proof-of-concept.
* Communicate what youd did:
  * Who was your audience?
  * What was their need?
  * How did you test ideas?
  * What did you come up with?

---
# Final Project  

---
# Types of Projects
* An augmented reality tour.
* Explain a difficult concept using technology.
* Enhance a user's experience.
* Address issues related to inclusion and representation in museum settings.

---
# Next Week

* Respond to the Introductions forum if you haven't already.
* Choose your own adventure: Discussions/Explorations
* Look ahead to the [Your Museum Journey](https://courses.ischool.illinois.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=302480) Activity.

# Technology in the Museum
## Good or Bad?

* This is be a short debate format.
* You will be divided into two groups.
* One group will argue why technology in the museum is good.

* The other group will argue why technology in the museum is problematic.
  * Describe examples of where technology diminished your experience.
* What are the implications for design of museum experiences?
