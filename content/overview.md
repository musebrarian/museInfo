# Course Overview
## Scope of Museum Informatics
This course will explore issues related to the use of digital technologies in museums. This includes both how museums use computers to record, preserve, classify and manage their collections, and how digital technologies may be used to help visitors and scholars to make their most of their museums visits.

I use the word 'Museum' as a very loose term in the title of the course.  Part of our exploration will be to explore what "museum" means in digital spaces.  Professionally, "museum" covers a wide variety of organizations, including art, history, science, and natural history), but also includes historic homes and sites, zoos, botanical gardens, etc. (see [American Alliance of Museums - About Museums](https://www.aam-us.org/programs/about-museums/)).  More broadly we can talk about "cultural heritage" that also includes Galleries, Archives, Libraries, and Museums (a.k.a. #GLAM). We can also think beyond collections of "things" to look at how we gather, document, and preserve "[intangible heritage](https://ich.unesco.org/en/what-is-intangible-heritage-00003)."  Information and digital technologies have impacted all of these, but often is used in very different ways.  

_**This class encourages you to find your place in this broad area of activity and draw upon your own experience and expertise.**_

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course you will be able to
* Understand the scope and scale of technology used in museum settings;
* Understand and distinguish different audiences for museum technologies;
* Critically examine the strengths and weaknesses of digital technology in museums;
* Appraise the potential for new technologies to impact museum practice using user-centered methods.
* Successfully design and develop an appropriate museum technology project for use in a particular settting.

## Who Is This Class Intended For?

This is a class offered through the School of Information Sciences. It is open to students from other departments.

The class is aimed both at people who consider themselves as mostly a museum-interested person or a technology-interested person. In either case we are looking at applying computers in museums.

Museum Informatics is interdisciplinary work and so we hope that we will have students from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds. By working together on various short projects we will learn how to make best use of the diversity of our skills, backgrounds and intellectual traditions.

## Prerequisites
None formally, but there are things you need to know about:

*   If you have never taken an online class in the iSchool before:
  * you need to familiarize yourself with the technologies that we use (Moodle and Blackboard Collaborate) See the [main BBC page](https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/) for details
  *   check out the [technology requirements](http://www.lis.illinois.edu/academics/itd)
*   You should be comfortable fiddling around with technologies that might be new to you like blogs, wikis, maybe trying to create your first podcast.
*   You should be willing to try to design a new kind of museum technology experience. The course will show you how, and you don't need prior design expertise.

## Expectations
You are expected to have a go and try out the techniques and explore the ideas covered in this course. I'm not expecting you to be or to magically become computer scientists, coders, or information scientists. I am expecting you to apply your existing skills and knowledge to think about applications of technology in a museum setting.

The best way to think is to do. So we will be trying out existing applications, and will work on trying to build something that might meet a particular need better than traditional approaches. That involves building with technology, although it does not necessarily involve programming. But you will need to know how to design . That is to decide what to construct. If you have never done that before, don't worry - I will be explicitly teaching you how to do that.

All the  assignments are designed to make it easy to have a go, to experiment, to try something out that may fail disastrously or may turn out to be much more successful than you thought. But you can only expect people to do it if you provide a safety net for the odd inevitable disaster. I'm assuming you have never done engineering-style analysis and design before. It is my job to help you explore this. It is your job to be willing to try this, no matter how odd it may feel. It does not require immense effort, but it does require time, thought and practice (lots of very short bursts).

 This course is about first understanding the ideas, no matter how strange they may seem, and then we test the ideas by building and evaluating things. That is the measure of success - does it work in practice? Nor is it the kind of course where you can blitz all the work in a couple of all-nighters at the last minute. Trust me - such design work is universally awful.
