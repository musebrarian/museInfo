# Course Policies

## Absences
I acknowledge that many of you have full time jobs/careers/family obligations. I am willing to work with students to successfully complete all work required to pass the course by the end of semester. However, this works best if we keep communications open and frank.  If you are struggling for any reason, please reach out to me for assistance.

If you choose to be a member of a group, please respect the time and effort of your group mates.  If unforeseen circumstances arise, communicate to both your teammates and myself.

If you are experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression or are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or in crisis, you can seek help through the following campus resources:

* Counseling Center
  206 Fred H. Turner Student Services Building
  7:50 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday
  Phone: 333-3704

* McKinley Mental Health
  313 McKinley Health Center
  8:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday

## Academic Integrity
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Student Code should also be considered as a part of this syllabus. Students should pay particular attention to Article 1, Part 4: Academic Integrity. Read the Code at the following URL: http://studentcode.illinois.edu/.
Academic dishonesty may result in a failing grade. Every student is expected to review and abide by the Academic Integrity Policy: http://studentcode.illinois.edu/. Ignorance is not an excuse for any academic dishonesty. It is your responsibility to read this policy to avoid any misunderstanding. Do not hesitate to ask the instructor(s) if you are ever in doubt about what constitutes plagiarism, cheating, or any other breach of academic integrity.

## Accommodations
To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor and the Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) as soon as possible. To contact DRES, you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603, e-mail disability@illinois.edu or go to the DRES website.  If you are concerned you have a disability-related condition that is impacting your academic progress, there are academic screening appointments available on campus that can help diagnosis a previously undiagnosed disability by visiting the DRES website and selecting “Sign-Up for an Academic Screening” at the bottom of the page.

If you are interested in obtaining information to improve writing, study skills, time management or organization, the following campus resources are available to all students:

* Writer’s Workshop
  Undergrad Library

* [Strategies](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/strategies)

Also, most college offices and academic deans provide academic skills support and assistance for academically related and personal problems.
