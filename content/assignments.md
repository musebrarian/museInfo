In order to work together as a learning community we all need to get a sense of who people are, their interests and where they are coming from. It also helps a lot to know the different skills that
people have. I hope we can build on the diversity of skills and experience of us all as the course unfolds.

So please create a brief description of yourself including sections on your experience with:

Museum studies (classes taken, work done in museums)
Domain expertise related to a certain kind of museum (art, history, science, botany, zoology, etc.)
Technical design expertise Whether you know any programming languages and if so to what extent. Whether you have created websites, blogs, videos, podcasts, machinima, Second Life artifacts
Learning technology expertise. Whether you have taken an online class at the iSchool before. Whether you have taken another kind of e-learning class before. Whether you have contributed to a wiki before.
Your favorite museum and why.
Format:

Post your intro to the relevant forum as a new thread. Do take the opportunity to read other people's introductions.
I've posted about me as an example.
