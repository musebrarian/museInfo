# Assignments and Methods of Assessment

*	All assignments are required for all students. Completing all assignments is not a guarantee of a passing grade.
*	All work must be completed in order to pass this class. Late or incomplete assignments will not be given full credit unless the student has contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or in the case of emergencies, as soon as practicable).
*	Late or incomplete assignments will not be given full credit unless the student has contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or in the case of emergencies, as soon as practicable).
*	Criteria for grading homework assignments include (but are not limited to) creativity and the amount of original work demonstrated in the assignment. However, students are permitted to use and adapt the work of others, provided that the following guidelines are followed:
  *	Use of other peopleâ€™s material must not infringe the copyright of the original author, nor violate the terms of any licensing agreement. Know and respect the principles of fair use with respect to copyrighted material.
  *	Students must scrupulously attribute the original source and author of whatever material has been adapted for the assignment. Summarize the changes or adaptations that have been made. Make plain how much of the assignment represents original work.

## Overall Grade Categories

* Discussions and Explorations: 25%
* Activities: 25%
* Project Assignments:50%
* Total: 100%

Many of the assignments are completed in open forums and/or wiki spaces. They are the online equivalent of sharing stories and experiences in class. They are also a bit like a design studio in Art or Architecture where we look at what each other is doing, offer suggestions and gain inspiration for our own projects.

Part of the process of being an expert is to build up a body of experiences and a large set of examples against which to gauge theories and abstractions. That is of course time consuming. Sharing other peoples examples and experiences is efficient. So that means it is not cheating to read other assignments In fact it is encouraged. But if you learn something from reading another person's assignment, you should acknowledge this. In particular if you use that insight in your own assignment, you should credit the help you have received from others. This approach is similar to a studio arts class where people have a space in a big public studio and construct their project on a table over a semester, and people swing by and make comments on the ongoing work-in-progress.

However, please become familiar with the Course Policies related to Academic Integrity. While collaborative learning is encouraged, blatant plagiarism or failure to demonstrate that you have put in your own effort is not.

## Evaluation Rubrics

### Discussions and Explorations

Discussions and Explorations are ongoing throughout the course. There is also an overall course grade for In-Class participation worth a total of 10 points.

For each week, you may earn up to five points that are averaged across the semester (dropping the lowest score).

### Activities
Activities are hands-on tasks each student must complete. In some cases these are discussion forums, but we will also be working collaboratively in the class wiki.

Both Activities and Discussions and Explorations will be assessed according to the following rubric:
