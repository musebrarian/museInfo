# Course Description
## Scope of Museum Informatics

This course will explore issues related to the use of digital technologies in museums. This includes both how museums use computers to record, preserve, classify and manage their collections, and how digital technologies may be used to help visitors and scholars to make their most of their museums visits.

I use the word 'Museum' as a very loose term in the title of the course.  Part of our exploration will be to explore what "museum" means in digital spaces.  Professionally, "museum" covers a wide variety of organizations, including art, history, science, and natural history), but also includes historic homes and sites, zoos, botanical gardens, etc. (see [American Alliance of Museums - About Museums](https://www.aam-us.org/programs/about-museums/)).  More broadly we can talk about "cultural heritage" that also includes Galleries, Archives, Libraries, and Museums (a.k.a. #GLAM). We can also think beyond collections of "things" to look at how we gather, document, and preserve "[intangible heritage](https://ich.unesco.org/en/what-is-intangible-heritage-00003)."  Information and digital technologies have impacted all of these, but often is used in very different ways.  

_**This class encourages you to find your place in this broad area of activity and draw upon your own experience and expertise.**_

## Prerequisites
None formally, but there are things you need to know about:

*   If you have never taken an online class in the iSchool before:
  * you need to familiarize yourself with the technologies that we use (Moodle and Blackboard Collaborate) See the [main BBC page](https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/) for details
  *   check out the [technology requirements](http://www.lis.illinois.edu/academics/itd)
*   You should be comfortable fiddling around with technologies that might be new to you like blogs, wikis, maybe trying to create your first podcast.
*   You should be willing to try to design a new kind of museum technology experience. The course will show you how, and you don't need prior design expertise.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course you will be able to

* Understand the scope and scale of technology used in museum settings;
* Understand and distinguish different audiences for museum technologies;
* Critically examine the strengths and weaknesses of digital technology in museums;
* Appraise the potential for new technologies to impact museum practice using user-centered methods.
* Successfully design and develop an appropriate museum technology project for use in a particular setting.
