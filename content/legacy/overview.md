# Course Overview

This course will explore issues related to the use of digital technologies in museums. This includes both how museums use computers to record, preserve, classify and manage their collections, and how digital technologies may be used to help visitors and scholars to make their most of their museums visits.

I use the word 'Museum' as a very loose term in the title of the course.  Part of our exploration will be to explore what "museum" means in digital spaces.  Professionally, "museum" covers a wide variety of organizations, including art, history, science, and natural history), but also includes historic homes and sites, zoos, botanical gardens, etc. (see [American Alliance of Museums - About Museums](https://www.aam-us.org/programs/about-museums/)).  More broadly we can talk about "cultural heritage" that also includes Galleries, Archives, Libraries, and Museums (a.ka. #GLAM). We can also think beyond collections of "things" to look at how we gather, document, and preserve "[intangible heritage](https://ich.unesco.org/en/what-is-intangible-heritage-00003)."  Information and digital technologies have impacted all of these, but often is used in very different ways.  

_**This class encourages you to find your place in this broad area of activity and draw upon your own experience and expertise. **_

We will consider how digital technologies are or could be used in museum settings. This can mean many different things including:

*   computerized collections records databases
*   computerization of the management processes of a museum
*   federation of information among museums
*   providing online access to museum collections
*   museum websites and user experiences
*   online web-based interactive experiences
*   computer kiosks within museums
*   large screen displays in museums
*   mobile technologies for supplementing museum visits
*   use of ubiquitous computing technologies
*   use of web, tablet and smartphone applications
*   augmented and virtual reality

By the end of the course you will be able to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of existing applications used in a museum setting. You will also be able to consider the ways in which technologies may be assembled to create new kinds of applications for use in a museum setting. Furthermore I hope you will be able to analyze novel technologies and consider their potential for future use in museum settings. This kind of analysis will cover aspects of how people can learn how to use them, how they can be used to help people learn about the topic the museum is trying to explain and their appropriateness and practicality for use in a particular setting.

## Who Is This Class Intended For?

This is a class offered through the School of Information Sciences. It is open to students from other departments.

The class is aimed both at people who consider themselves as mostly a museum-interested person or a technology-interested person. In either case we are looking at applying computers in museums.

Museum Informatics is interdisciplinary work and so we hope that we will have students from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds. By working together on various short projects we will learn how to make best use of the diversity of our skills, backgrounds and intellectual traditions.

## Prerequisites

None formally, but there are things you need to know about:

*   If you have never taken an online class in the iSchool before,

*   you need to familiarize yourself with the technologies that we use (Moodle and Blackboard Collaborate) See the [main BBC page](https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/) for details
*   check out the [technology requirements](http://www.lis.illinois.edu/academics/itd)

*   You should be comfortable fiddling around with technologies that might be new to you like blogs, wikis, maybe trying to create your first podcast.
*   You should be willing to try to design a new kind of museum technology experience. The course will show you how, and you don't need prior design expertise.

## Assignments

There are a number of different assignments in the course.
By far the most important is the final project. This is where you design and implement some application that is related to museum informatics. It can take many forms. Examples include:

*   Create a proof of concept of a new technology applied in a museum setting
*   Build something interesting using blogging software
*   Create a very small online collections database
*   Create some audio tours for a museum
*   Use a toolkit to build a smartphone app
*   Show how online visualization tools might be used in a museum

More details to come. The point is that it does involve designing something. But you don't have to program in order to construct it. There are many technologies now that can be used with zero or minimal programming skill. We will spend quite a bit of time exploring how to design an appropriate and useful technological experience.

Many of the assignments for this class are really rather small-scale. In other circumstances I might call them Homework exercises. But I'll stick with the Moodle terminology. As a very rough approximation, here's their overall breakdown as they make up the final grade.

However note: 
1) You do need to do all the assignments. You can't get an A by doing some spectacularly well and omitting others. 
2) Several assignments are not so much assessments of what you have learned as activities I want you to do in order to learn.

Pretty much all the assignments are public. They are the online equivalent of sharing stories and experiences in class. They are also a bit like a design studio in Art or Architecture where we look at what each other is doing, offer suggestions and gain inspiration for our own projects.

Part of the process of being an expert is to build up a body of experiences and a large set of examples against which to gauge theories and abstractions. That is of course time consuming. Sharing other peoples examples and experiences is efficient. So that means it is not cheating to read other assignments In fact it is encouraged. But if you learn something from reading another person's assignment, you should acknowledge this. In particular if you use that insight in your own assignment, you should credit the help you have received from others. This approach is similar to a studio arts class where people have a space in a big public studio and construct their project on a table over a semester, and people swing by and make comments on the ongoing work-in-progress.

## Expectations

You are expected to have a go and try out the techniques and explore the ideas covered in this course. I'm not expecting you to be or to magically become computer scientists, coders, or information scientists. I am expecting you to apply your existing skills and knowledge to think about applications of technology in a museum setting. But the best way to think is to do. So we will be trying out existing applications, and will work on trying to build something that might meet a particular need better than traditional approaches. That involves building with technology, although it does not necessarily involve programming. An increasing number of technological gadgets allow you do do very creative things with them without needing to know how to program. But you will need to know how to design . That is to decide what to construct. If you have never done that before, don't worry - I will be explicitly teaching you how to do that.

All the  assignments are designed to make it easy to have a go, to experiment, to try something out that may fail disastrously or may turn out to be much more successful than you thought. The trendy management slogan is risk-taking behavior. But you can only expect people to do it if you provide a safety net for the odd inevitable disaster. I'm assuming you have never done engineering-style analysis and design before. It is my job to help you explore this. It is your job to be willing to try this, no matter how odd it may feel. It does not require immense effort, but it does require time, thought and practice (lots of very short bursts).

So if you like a course where you read about stuff and then regurgitate it in little essays, then this is not the course for you. Nor is it a course in personal reactions to readings: I don't really care how you feel about them. Actually I do care if you find parts of a reading confusing. Tell us about it so we as a class can try and clarify it. This course is about first understanding the ideas, no matter how strange they may seem, and then we test the ideas by building and evaluating things. That is the measure of success - does it work in practice? Nor is it the kind of course where you can blitz all the work in a couple of all-nighters at the last minute. Trust me - such design work is universally awful.

**You are expected to do ALL the assignments.** You cannot get an A by doing a few of them excellently and skipping one you don't like - it is not marked by an accumulation of numbers. Rather as an assessment of the portfolio of activities. The flipside of this is that you need not get too hung up on doing an outstanding job first time through. Obviously you are only just beginning, and may not know what is expected. Indeed sometimes I make you do an assignments BEFORE the relevant readings in order to make the readings more meaningful. That is, the assignments are really part of the learning (to help you understand the next bit) rather than the assessment (to see if you understand it now). Doing it and reflecting on what you have learned and what you would do next time is the important thing, rather than worrying about doing it perfectly.

The submission deadlines are about when you must send in a complete version. BUT, as we are doing this electronically, you are always at liberty to subsequently add more, tweak and tidy what you did before etc. This is an artifact of the medium, but one that I encourage. I look through all your work again at the end of the course when computing your final grade. Main result - there are many ways of recovering from early disasters when you were still learning the techniques that the assignments were about. Most real work is frequently revisited, revised and improved. I believe that coursework should emulate the real world. I consider this approach both more humane and pedagogically effective. But it is DIFFERENT to the conventional approach. People get worried about it when they keep slipping back into thinking it really is the conventional approach and I'm just pretending it isn't.

You are expected to participate in the discussions of the weekly readings. See my post in the Week 1 reading forum for more details.

The minimum acceptable number of weekly reading posts for a A grade is 10\. These must be posted in a reasonably timely manner. Churning them out at the end of the semester does not count - because that does not help other class members make use of your insights.

As well as the discussions on the weekly readings you are also expected to actively participate in the live sessions. This includes asking questions but also when I put you into small groups for discussion - sometimes you may not have anything to say to me in the main session and that's OK.

You are strongly encouraged to read and comment on the posts by other students, including the various assignments. This isn't cheating. We are doing this class as a collective learning activity. Just remember to acknowledge when reading something created by someone else has inspired you to write or revise something.
